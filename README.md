# C++ Algorithms and Games Collection

This repository contains a curated collection of C++ programs implementing various algorithms, search strategies, and classic games. These programs are designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in computer science and artificial intelligence. Each implementation is accompanied by comments for better understanding and is aimed at students, developers, and enthusiasts looking to learn and explore these techniques.

## Highlights of the Repository

### 1. **Search and Graph Algorithms**  
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: A level-order traversal algorithm for graphs or trees, useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: A backtracking-based traversal technique for exploring all possible paths in graphs or trees.  
- **Best-First Search**: A heuristic-based search algorithm that prioritizes nodes based on a specific evaluation function.  
- **A* Algorithm**: Combines the strengths of BFS and heuristics for optimal pathfinding in weighted graphs.  

### 2. **Artificial Intelligence Techniques**  
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implements decision-making for two-player games, ensuring optimal moves for the AI.  
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Optimized version of Minimax that reduces the search space while maintaining accuracy.  

### 3. **Classic Problems and Games**  
- **Knight's Tour Problem**: Solve the classic chessboard problem where a knight visits every square exactly once.  
- **Tic-Tac-Toe with AI**: A fully functional Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent using Minimax.
